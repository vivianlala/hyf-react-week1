             My experience in sweden has been very intresting, I would said both positive and negative. Positive because i
             fell inlove and negative because it has been a roller-coaster especially 
             when it comes to language and my career path-which i feel sometimes like i am in a 'limbo'.

         which makes me very inquisitive about the future in relation to information & technology. With this urge I am eager to learn more about the computer language and interactions
