         <p>
             My names is Vivian Lala Omdal. I’m a Kenyan currently living in Sweden. 
             I moved to Sweden almost 5years ago to pursure a Master programme in International
             Migration and Ethnic Relations at Malmö University. I am currently living outside Malmö, married with one kid.

             My experience in sweden has been very intresting, I would said both positive and negative. Positive because i
             fell inlove and negative because it has been a roller-coaster especially 
             when it comes to language and my career path-which i feel sometimes like i am in a 'limbo'.
